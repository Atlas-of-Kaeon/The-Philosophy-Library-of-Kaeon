			Fourth wall transcendence occurs when entities that originate in or as simulations
			exert influence beyond said simulations by means of directly interfacing with external
			applications or devices, or when they become sentient.

			Such entities are referred to as Sigma entities if they are not sentient, and as Sigma
			beings if they are sentient.
