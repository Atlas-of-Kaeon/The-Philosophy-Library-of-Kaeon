			Kaeon rhetoric is a style of rhetoric that abides by the following principles: it must
			state its position without doing anything or acknowledging anything that would suggest
			that said position is anything less than the absolute truth, it must be impersonal and
			unbiased, it must not be redundant, it must cover every detail relevant to its
			position, and it must not discuss anything that is irrelevant to its position.
