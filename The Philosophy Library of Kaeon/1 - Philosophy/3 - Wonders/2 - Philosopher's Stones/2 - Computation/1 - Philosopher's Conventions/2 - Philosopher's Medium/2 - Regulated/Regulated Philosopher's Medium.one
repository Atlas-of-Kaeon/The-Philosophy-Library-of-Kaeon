			A module that abides by the regulated Philosopher's Medium shall have the on incoming
			function and the on outgoing function, and shall be known as a regulated Philosopher's
			Stone module.

			The aforementioned functions are used to restrict access to certain regions of a given
			Philosopher's Atlas during traversals of it.

			Functions
		-
			-
				On Incoming
			-
				-
					The on incoming function takes a list of modules representing a traversal path,
					as well as a value specifying any additional information as arguments.
					
					It returns true if the module it was called from should be considered part of a
					given traversal, and returns false otherwise.
					
					It may be redefined for each regulated Philosopher's Stone module, and may
					perform any operations before returning.

					It returns true by default.
				-
			-
				On Outgoing
			-
				-
					The on outgoing function takes a list of modules representing a traversal path
					as well as a value specifying any additional information as arguments. The list
					must contain at least two modules, with the second to last module in the list
					being the one the function was called from, and the last module in the list
					being the next one in the projected traversal.
					
					It returns true if a given traversal should continue from the module it was
					called from to the last stone in the passed in list, and returns false
					otherwise.
					
					It may be redefined for each regulated Philosopher's Stone module, and may
					perform any operations before returning.
					
					It returns true by default.

			Traversals
		-
			-
				When a traversal of a Philosopher's Atlas travels through a regulated Philosopher's
				Stone module, the on incoming function of the regulated Philosopher's stone module
				in question shall be called using a list containing every previously traversed
				module, as well as a value specifying any additional information. If the on
				incoming function returns true, the traversal shall progress to the module in
				question.
				
				If a traversal has progressed past the on incoming function of a given regulated
				Philosopher's Stone module, the on outgoing function of said regulated
				Philosopher's Stone module must be called for every module that the regulated
				Philosopher's Stone module in question is connected to that itself has not yet been
				traversed. A list containing every previously traversed module, the regulated
				Philosopher's Stone module in question, and the next module in the projected
				traversal shall be passed to the on outgoing function, along with a value
				specifying any additional information. The traversal will proceed to each
				connection that the on outgoing function returns true for.
