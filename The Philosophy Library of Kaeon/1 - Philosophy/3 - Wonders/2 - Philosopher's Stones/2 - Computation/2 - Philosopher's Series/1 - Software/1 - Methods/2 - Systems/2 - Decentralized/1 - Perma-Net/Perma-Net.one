			Decentralized platforms that backup records such that they cannot be deleted are called
			perma-platforms, and said records are referred to as perma-content.

			Perma-platforms that can be used by any party to backup any data are referred to as
			open perma-platforms.

			The collective of all perma-platforms and perma-content is called the perma-net.
