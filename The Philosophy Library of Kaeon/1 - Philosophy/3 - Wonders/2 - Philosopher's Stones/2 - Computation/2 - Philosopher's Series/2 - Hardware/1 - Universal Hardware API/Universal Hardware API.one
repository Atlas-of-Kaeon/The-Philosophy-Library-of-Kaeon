				When a device that follows the protocol is turned on, it shall connect to a
				network, and shall respond to text data sent through calls made to an online
				endpoint located at a static address. Said calls shall return text data to the
				caller.

				The network that a device which follows the protocol connects to shall be a
				wireless network with an indefinite range.
