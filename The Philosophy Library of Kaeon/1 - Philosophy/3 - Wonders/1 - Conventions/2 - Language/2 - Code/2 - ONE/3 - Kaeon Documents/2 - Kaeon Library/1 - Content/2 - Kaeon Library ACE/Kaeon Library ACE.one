			A library directory within a Kaeon library may be interpreted as a Kaeon ACE entity by
			interpreting the contents of its library directory document as a Kaeon ACE entity, and
			then by interpreting its child directories in the same manner as child Kaeon ACE
			entities of said Kaeon ACE entity.

			If the library directory document is an ACE Kaeon document, then the Kaeon ACE entity
			generated shall have all of the entities within the usage document derived from said
			library directory document as children.

			If the library directory document is not an ACE Kaeon document, then the Kaeon ACE
			entity generated shall be a Kaeon document utility interface entity derived from said
			document.
