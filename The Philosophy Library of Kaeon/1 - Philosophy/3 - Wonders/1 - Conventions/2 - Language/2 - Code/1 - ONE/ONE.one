				ONE stores data in elements.
				
				An element must contain a string of characters, and may act as a parent to other
				elements.
				
				The children of a given element must be arranged in a specific order relative to
				each other. No element may be the child of more than one element, and no loops may
				occur in the chain of parent-child connections.
