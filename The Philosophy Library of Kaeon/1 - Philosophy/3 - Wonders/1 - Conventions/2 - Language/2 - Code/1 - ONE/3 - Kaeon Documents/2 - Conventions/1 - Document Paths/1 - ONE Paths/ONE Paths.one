			A ONE path is a series of numbers used to identify a specific element within the scope
			of a given element, where the first number in said sequence, zero, corresponds to said
			given element, and each subsequent number represents a child of the element represented
			by the number it follows, with said number specifying the index of the element it
			represents.
