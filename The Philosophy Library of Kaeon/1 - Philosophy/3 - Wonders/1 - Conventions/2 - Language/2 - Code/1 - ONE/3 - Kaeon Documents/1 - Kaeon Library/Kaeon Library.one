			Structure
		-
			-
				All of the contents of a Kaeon library are contained within a directory called the
				master directory. The name of the master directory will be the name of the library.

				A general directory may contain multiple miscellaneous documents and directories.
				
				A library directory, which the master directory is one of, may contain multiple
				directories within it, which may either be library directories or general
				directories, may contain a single document, called a library directory document, or
				may contain both.

				Directories within a library directory must be arranged in a specific order.

			Standard Kaeon Library
		-
			-
				A standard Kaeon library is a Kaeon library where all of the library directory
				documents are Kaeon documents.
				
				The naming convention for library directories other than the master directory in a
				standard Kaeon library is that they must consist of a number signifying its
				intended index relative to the other library directories within its parent
				directory, followed by a space, followed by a dash, followed by another space,
				followed by a string signifying the nature of its contents.
