					Items Documents

					-
						An item document is a Kaeon document specifying a resource pertaining to a
						given Kaeon library.

						An item document's name and title shall match the name of the resource that
						it pertains to.
						
						A standard item document shall describe the resource that it pertains to in
						its philosophy section, and may optionally have the principles section
						present, which may contain an element with the content "UIID", which, if
						present, shall have a child with content specifying the UIID of the
						resource to which its document pertains, and may also contain an element
						with the content "Details", under which any other element specifying
						miscellaneous about the resource to which its document pertains may be
						nested.

				-
					Item Document Arrangement
				-
					-
						All item documents shall be nested within a subfolder of the reference
						folder with the title "Items".

						An item document specifying the Kaeon library to which it belongs shall be
						nested in a subfolder of the items folder with the title "Source".

						Item documents specifying resources that may be derived from the content of
						the Kaeon library to which it belongs and the resources that said library
						is connected to shall be nested in a subfolder of the items folder with the
						title "Derivative".

						Item documents specifying external resources relative to the Kaeon library
						to which it belongs shall be nested in a subfolder of the items folder with
						the title "External".

						A folder containing an item document nested within the derivative or
						external folders shall be nested within a subfolder of said folder, the
						title of which shall specify the category to which the resource that said
						item document pertains to belongs.

					Item Document Categories
				-
					-
						The categories that item documents in the derivative and external folders
						may belong to include, but are not limited to, "Applications", specifying
						computer software, "Atlases", specifying Kaeon library atlases,
						"Documents", specifying Kaeon documents, "Entities", specifying
						miscellaneous resources, "Libraries", specifying Kaeon libraries, and
						"Orders", specifying Orders of Kaeon.

					Item Document Content
				-
					-
						In addition to the UIID and details elements, the principles elements of
						item documents which specify applications or atlases may have an additional
						child with the content "Content".

						For an item document specifying an application, the content element, if
						present, may have an indefinite number of children, each of which may
						either have a location at which to find the application to which said
						document pertains, or a command through which said application may be
						initiated. If more than one such child is present, the locations and
						commands specified by elements with lower indices shall take priority.

						For an item document specifying an atlas, the content element, if present,
						may have an indefinite number of children, each of which shall contain
						content specifying the name of a resource in said atlas.

			-
				Directory
			-
				-
					The reference folder may have a subfolder with the name "Directory". The
					directory folder shall contain a single Kaeon document with the name and title
					"Directory".

					The principles section of the directory file may have an indefinite number of
					children, each of which may contain the name of a resource pertaining to the
					library to which the convention is applied. Said children shall be arranged in
					alphabetical order.

					Each of said children may itself optionally have an indefinite number of
					children, each of which contains content specifying a location at which the
					resource referenced by its parent is located.
