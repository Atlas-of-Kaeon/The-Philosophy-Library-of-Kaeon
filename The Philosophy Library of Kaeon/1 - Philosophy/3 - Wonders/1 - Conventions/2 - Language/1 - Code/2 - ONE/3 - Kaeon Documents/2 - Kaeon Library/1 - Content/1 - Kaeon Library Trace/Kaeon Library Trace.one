			Library and general directories within Kaeon libraries, and the documents within them,
			may function as tag trace modules, with their names, aliases, and indices functioning
			as trace tags, and their children functioning as their connections.

			These conventions can be applied to generic folders if they are interpreted as isolated
			general directories.
