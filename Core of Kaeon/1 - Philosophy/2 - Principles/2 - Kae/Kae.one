			Kae, which means both "will" and "way", refers to willpower, dedication, or resolve,
			called sakae ("sah-kai"), the results of the application of sakae, called takae
			("tah-kai"), and that towards which sakae is directed at any given time, called jakae
			("jah-kai").

			Sakae not directed towards jakae is called nakae ("nah-kai"), and sakae directed
			towards jakae is called vakae ("vah-kai").

				A-Kae
			-
				-
					A-Kae ("Ah Kai"), or "supreme will", refers to indomitable vakae that holds its
					resolve regardless of practical circumstances.

				O-Kae
			-
				-
					An O-Kae ("Oh Kai"), or "total will", is the set of things that compose the
					ultimate focus of one's life, thus constituting the ultimate jakae.

					If one's O-Kae is fulfilled, then a new, higher degree O-Kae takes its place.
