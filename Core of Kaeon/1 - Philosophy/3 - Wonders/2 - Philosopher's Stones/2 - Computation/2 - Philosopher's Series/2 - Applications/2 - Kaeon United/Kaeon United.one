			Kaeon United is an online API that provides a unified interface to Kaeon FUSION and to
			various other tools relevant to it, and shall also serve as both a modular shadow host
			and as a modular service.

			Kaeon United may be used as a Kaeon FUSION interface, which shall cause the Kaeon
			FUSION interpreter to use all of the most generally relevant Kaeon FUSION interfaces.

			Kaeon United may expand its functionality through the use of interface modules.
