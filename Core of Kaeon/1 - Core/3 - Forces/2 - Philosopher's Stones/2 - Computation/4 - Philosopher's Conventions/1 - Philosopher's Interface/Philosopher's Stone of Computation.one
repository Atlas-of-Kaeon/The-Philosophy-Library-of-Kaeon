			The Philosopher's Interface is an interface for dynamically invoking any operation such
			that if said operation causes an error, then said operation shall terminate, said error
			shall be caught, and a null value shall be returned, and if said operation finishes
			successfully, then if said operation returns a value, said value shall be returned, and
			if said operation returns no value, a null value shall be returned.
