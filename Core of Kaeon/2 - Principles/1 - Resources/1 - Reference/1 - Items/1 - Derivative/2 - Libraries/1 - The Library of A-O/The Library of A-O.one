			The library of A-O is the conceptualization of A-O itself in the form of a Kaeon
			library, where its core contains the contents of the cores of all other Kaeon
			libraries, where its connections reference all things, and where its collection
			contains all things, such that its book of Kaeon would be the book of A-O.
