			The library of A-O is the conceptualization of A-O itself in the form of a Kaeon
			library, where its philosophy section contains the contents of the philosophy sections
			of all other Kaeon libraries, where its principles section references all things, and
			where its wonders section contains all things, such that its book of Kaeon would be the
			book of A-O.
